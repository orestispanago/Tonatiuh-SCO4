# Tonatiuh-SCO4

##### Contents:

 * Basic ```.tnh``` Tonatiuh  projects for a micro-mirror array concentrating solar thermal system
 * ```.tnhs``` Tonatiuh script to automate ray-tracing for multiple solar angles in the transversal and longitudinal direction
 * python script to read the  ```.db``` Tonatiuh output files, process and visualize the data


##### Running the automation script
In order to run the ```.tnhs``` automation script, you need to open the ```.tnh``` project and trace the system first (no export is necessary). Otherwise, the Surface IDs will not be saved to the ```.db``` files. Do not save the ```.tnh``` file on exit.
